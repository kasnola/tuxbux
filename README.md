# tuxbux

An idle game for the terminal, made with Textual

![Shameless cookie clicker clone](./TUXBUX.png)

# How to install

Do `pip install textual`, or `pipx install textual`

Tested on Python 3.12.3, Textual 2.12. Those should be the only dependencies + your favorite terminal emulator!

**Untested on Windows!** The save & load mechanic _should_ work, though.
